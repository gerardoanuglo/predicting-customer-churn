## Objective
To build a supervised machine learning model that accurately predicts wether a customer from a telecommunication company will churn or not and to identify the key metrics that impact this decision. 

## Business Problem
A multinational telecommunication company wants to know why customers are churning in hopes of   reducing the churn rate therby increasing company growth which in turn will increase revenue and profits. 

In order for company growth to take place the churn rate, the percentage of subcribers who discontinue their subscriptions to a business within a given time period, has to be lower than the rate of new customers subscribing to the business.
